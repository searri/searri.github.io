Not only can online hate content spread easily between social media platforms, but its focus can also evolve over time. Machine learning and other artificial intelligence (AI) tools could play a key role in helping human moderators understand how such hate topics are evolving online. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) has been shown to be able to identify hate topics from a corpus of text associated with online communities that promote hate. However, applying LDA to each dayâ€™s data is impractical since the inferred topic list from the optimization can change abruptly from day to day, even though the underlying text and hence topics do not typically change this quickly. Hence, LDA is not well suited to capture the way in which hate topics evolve and morph. Here we solve this problem by showing that a dynamic version of LDA can help capture this evolution of topics surrounding online hate. Specifically, we show how standard and dynamical LDA models can be used in conjunction to analyze the topics over time emerging from extremist communities across multiple moderated and unmoderated social media platforms. Our dataset comprises material that we have gathered from hate related communities on Facebook, Telegram, and Gab during the time period January-April 2021. We demonstrate the ability of dynamic LDA to shed light on how hate groups use different platforms in order to propagate their cause and interests across the online multiverse of social media platforms.
