One of the projects I worked on in Fall 2018 was a game in Java. 
I have continued to update and improve it. You can view the <a href="https://github.com/searri/Alien-Attack" target="_blank">full code repository on GitHub.</a>

### Instructions for use
- Make sure your machine has <a href="https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml" target="_blank">Java installed</a>
- Download the "Source Code (zip)" from the <a href="https://github.com/searri/Alien-Attack/releases" target="_blank">latest release</a>
- Extract the zipped directory on your machine
- Double click the jar file to launch

### An important note
If you want to resize the game screen, do it with the game menu window before starting the game. If you resize the game window during the game, everything will still be restricted to the window size it was in when you first started.

Enjoy!
