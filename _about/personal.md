Rick has a degree in Computer Science from the George Washington University, with minors in Physics and Mathematics. He hails from Wisconsin and is interested in artificial intelligence, in particular its applications in computational social science.

He currently works as a Research Assistant for a team at GW studying precisely that: check out the DON Lab's <a href="https://donlab.columbian.gwu.edu/" target="_blank">website</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gwdonlab" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>.

During his time as an undergrad, Rick was involved in <a href="https://gw-robotics.github.io/" target="_blank">GW Robotics</a>, GW's chapter of the ACM, and the GW Tabletop Gaming Society -- affectionately known as "board games club." He is still an avid board gamer; his favorite is <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion" target="_blank">Dominion</a>.

Rick was also the Layout Manager for the <a href="http://www.gwur.org/" target="_blank">GW Undergraduate Review</a>. Check out their most <a href="https://issuu.com/gwur" target="_blank">recent volumes online here</a>. These volumes are also available on <a href="https://scholarspace.library.gwu.edu/catalog?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search_field=all_fields&q=gw+undergraduate+review" target="_blank">GW's academic repository, ScholarSpace</a>. Rick was the artistic mind and architect for the first four volumes.
