Unfortunately, academic integrity rules prevent me from openly sharing the bulk of my work, as it consists mainly of class projects that are turned in for a grade.

But here are some of the things I've done over the years:
- Created a (simulated) basic CPU using CEDAR Logic (team project)
- Implemented a message encryption system using LC3 Assembly
- Built a document search engine in C, using the tf-idf search algorithm
- Made an arcade style video game in Java
- Built a full-stack AWS LAMP webapp for managing students and grades (team project)
- Implemented multithreading in the xv6 operating system
- Implemented process synchronization in the xv6 OS (using various types of locks)
- Created BrokerBot, an IoT device using Arduino and AWS (watch the video below, or <a href="https://github.com/searri/BrokerBot" target="_blank">check out my current updates to it here</a>)
- Implemented a non-neural NLP method for improving short-text topic classification tasks and replicated results (team project)
- Built a website for APSC 1001, a class he was Learning Assistant for: <a href="https://gwu-apsc1001.github.io/apsc1001-fall2020/" target="_blank">explore the archived website here</a>
- Built an Android app which uses object detection and depth mapping to act as a digital seeing eye dog (team project): <a href="https://searri.github.io/project-dog/" target="_blank">explore the website here</a>
