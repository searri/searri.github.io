  abstract  = {The COVID-19 pandemic sparked an online ``infodemic'' of potentially dangerous misinformation. We use machine learning to quantify COVID-19 content from opponents of establishment health guidance, in particular vaccination. We quantify this content in two different ways: number of topics and evolution of keywords. We find that, even in the early stages of the pandemic, the anti-vaccination community had the infrastructure to more effectively garner support than their pro-vaccination counterparts by exhibiting a broader array of discussion topics. This provided an advantage in terms of attracting new users seeking COVID-19 guidance online. We also find that our machine learning framework can pick up on the adaptive nature of discussions within the anti-vaccination community, tracking distrust of authorities, opposition to lockdown orders, and an interest in early vaccine trials. Our approach is scalable and hence tackles the urgent problem facing social media platforms of having to analyze huge volumes of online health misinformation. With vaccine booster shots being approved and vaccination rates stagnating, such an automated approach is key in understanding how to combat the misinformation that slows the eradication of the pandemic.},

  abstract = {The current military conflict between Russia and Ukraine is accompanied by disinformation and propaganda within the digital ecosystem of social media platforms and online news sources. One month prior to the conflict's February 2022 start, a Special Report by the U.S. Department of State had already highlighted concern about the extent to which Kremlin-funded media were feeding the online disinformation and propaganda ecosystem. Here we address a closely related issue: how Russian information sources feed into online extremist communities. Specifically, we present a preliminary study of how the sector of the online ecosystem involving extremist communities interconnects within and across social media platforms, and how it connects into such official information sources. Our focus here is on Russian domains, European Nationalists, and American White Supremacists. Though necessarily very limited in scope, our study goes beyond many existing works that focus on Twitter, by instead considering platforms such as VKontakte, Telegram, and Gab. Our findings can help shed light on the scope and impact of state-sponsored foreign influence operations. Our study also highlights the need to develop a detailed map of the full multi-platform ecosystem in order to better inform discussions aimed at countering violent extremism.}
