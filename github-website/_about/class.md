Unfortunately, academic integrity rules prevent me from openly sharing the bulk of my work, as it consists mainly of class projects that are turned in for a grade.

But here are some of the things I've done over the years:
- Created a (simulated) basic CPU using CEDAR Logic (team project)
- Implemented a message encryption system using LC3 Assembly
- Built a document search engine in C, using the tf-idf search algorithm
- Built a student/grade management tool using PHP and MySQL (team project)
- Implemented multithreading in the xv6 operating system
- Implemented process synchronization in the xv6 OS (using various types of locks)
- Created BrokerBot for an IoT class project:
