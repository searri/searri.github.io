Rick is currently studying Computer Science at the George Washington University, with minors in Physics and Mathematics. 
He hails from Wisconsin and is interested in artificial intelligence, nuclear physics, and philosophy (among other things).

He's heavily involved in GW Robotics, as well as being an active board gamer in GW's chapter of the ACM and the GW Tabletop Gaming Society.

To satisfy his artistic flair, Rick is the Layout Manager for the [GW Undergraduate Review](http://www.gwur.org/). Check out their most [recent volumes online here](https://issuu.com/gwur). These volumes are also available on [GW's academic repository, ScholarSpace](https://scholarspace.library.gwu.edu/catalog?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search_field=all_fields&q=gw+undergraduate+review).
